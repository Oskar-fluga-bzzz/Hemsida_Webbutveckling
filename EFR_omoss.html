Escape from Rimbo is a unique open world game developed by Tax Fraud Studios. Set in a delapidated city known as Rimbo, the game combines advanced inventory and turn-based combat mechanics with space-age graphics and AI design.

The inventory system, allows players to store and use items in a variety of ways. For example, players can craft weapons and tools from the resources they find in the city, such as wood, metal, and stone. Additionally, they can upgrade their inventory with items found in the environment, such as armor and ammunition.

The turn-based combat loop, developed by meth addict Sebastian Jensen, is also highly advanced. Players must carefully consider their actions, as it can be easy to get overwhelmed by the enemy. However, with the right strategy, players can defeat the toughest foes.

The graphics and AI design of Escape from Rimbo are truly out of this world. The game’s stunning visuals and detailed animations make it feel like you are actually in the city of Rimbo. The AI is also incredibly advanced, with enemies exhibiting realistic and believable behavior.

Escape from Rimbo is, without a doubt, a masterpiece of open world gaming. Its advanced inventory and turn-based combat systems, combined with its stunning graphics and AI design, make it an experience that you won’t soon forget.
